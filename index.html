            "Bangladesh is a country of villages. The majority of the people
            live in villages. The development of the country depends on the
            development of the villages. If we can develop the villages, we can
            develop the whole country. We have to make the villages self-reliant
            and self-sufficient. We have to make the villages the center of our
            development."
